/** A buffer to hold an array of floats.

        This is a simple container for an array of floats that can be used to store
        common values such as a waveshape or look-up table.
        Create one of these on the stack for most efficient and safe use.

        You can attach listners that inherit from Buffer::Listener to a Buffer
        to be notified when they change their contents using Buffer::addListener.
        This can be useful in updating UI elements such as wave displays.
